*   Force ``setup.py bdist_wheel`` to run ``clean --all``.
    Doing so blocks setuptools from dumping files for the wrong platform from
    the build cache folder into a wheel without any check to see if it is
    required.
    See :class:`cslug.building.bdist_wheel` for details.

* Support Android running Termux_.

*   .. rst-class:: in-red

        Drop the :c:`mblen()` function from :mod:`cslug.stdlib` due to its
        unavailability on Android.

*   Support Cygwin Python and Cygwin native |gcc|.
    Formerly, |cslug| supported a Cygwin environment but only using a regular
    MSVC build of Python and |gcc| cross compile headers for building generic
    Windows applications.
