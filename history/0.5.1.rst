* Fix compatibility with newer Python versions on MSYS2 which, for some
  reason, have started setting :data:`sys.platform` to ``cygwin`` instead of
  ``msys``.

* Redesign the :ref:`stdlib library selection<Access the C Standard Library>`
  giving it a generic default implementation which simply assumes POSIX
  compliance. Untested POSIXs or Linux distributions using alternative
  implementations of libc should work out the box provided that they follow the
  POSIX standard and :func:`ctypes.util.find_library` works on said platform.
  All the officially supported platforms should be unaffected.
