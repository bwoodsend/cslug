* Fix macOS wheel tag when building an ``arm64`` only wheel.

* Fix macOS wheel tags when building from a ``universal2`` build of Python.

    Make clang the default compiler on macOS and FreeBSD. Since these platforms
    officially use clang as their default compilers, clang is much more likely
    to be available. gcc is still used as a fallback if clang is not find-able.

* Expose all stdlib functions available on the current operating system.
  The original plan of making `cslug.stdlib` expose only symbols that are
  universally available on all platforms meant that, as cslug gained new
  platforms or newer versions of existing platforms deprecated functions (in
  particularly the dropping of the insecure family of functions that took NULL
  terminated string inputs), that the pool of functions cslug could expose was
  constantly shrinking and cslug was essentially having to make breaking
  changes every time. The new approach is simply to expose anything that's
  available on the current platform. The documentation (`cslug.stdlib`) lists
  which platforms each function can be used on.

    On Windows versions that support it (11 and, if the relevant update is
    installed, 10), use the new Universal C Runtime for `cslug.stdlib`. Unlike
    ``msvcrt.dll`` which `cslug` used originally, it receives updates and is
    officially documented and supported API so it shouldn't disappear at some
    unknown point in the future! The following functions are in ``msvcrt`` but
    not in UCRT: :ref:`ctime() <stdlib-ctime>`, :ref:`fprintf()
    <stdlib-fprintf>`, :ref:`fscanf() <stdlib-fscanf>`, :ref:`gmtime()
    <stdlib-gmtime>`, :ref:`localtime() <stdlib-localtime>`, :ref:`printf()
    <stdlib-printf>`, :ref:`scanf() <stdlib-scanf>`, :ref:`sprintf()
    <stdlib-sprintf>`, :ref:`sscanf() <stdlib-sscanf>`, :ref:`swprintf()
    <stdlib-swprintf>`, :ref:`swscanf() <stdlib-swscanf>`, :ref:`vfprintf()
    <stdlib-vfprintf>`, :ref:`vswprintf() <stdlib-vswprintf>`.

* Add support for clang on MSYS2.

* Add support for OpenBSD and NetBSD.
