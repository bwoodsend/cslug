Tools for integrating with :std:doc:`setuptools <setuptools>`.

Integration with ``setuptools`` is a somewhat messy affair. By putting a
:class:`cslug.CSlug` in a package, we now have to coerce our package setup to do
the following 5 things:

1. (Re)build all :class:`cslug.CSlug`\ s on ``setup.py build``.
2. Include C source code in sdists but exclude them from wheels.
3. Include |cslug| type jsons and |../binaries| of the correct OS in wheels but
   exclude them from sdists.
4. Mark |cslug| as a build-time dependency to be installed before trying to run
   ``setup.py build``.
5. Mark wheels as platform dependent but Python version independent.

    :param names: Names of :class:`~cslug.CSlug`\ s.
    :type names: str

    The syntax for a :class:`~cslug.CSlug` name is "module_name:attribute_name".
    For example, ``make("foo.bar:pop.my_slug")`` is equivalent to::

        from foo.bar import pop
        pop.my_slug.make()

    Of course, ``foo.bar`` must be importable for this to work.

    Multiple strings may be passed as arguments - this is just a lazy for loop.
    ``make("foo.slug", "bar.other_slug")`` is equivalent to::

        make("foo.slug")
        make("bar.other_slug")
